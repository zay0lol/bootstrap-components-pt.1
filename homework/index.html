        <h1>General information about spacecrafts!</h1>
        <p>A spacecraft is a vehicle that is designed to fly and operate in outer space.[1] Spacecraft are used for a
            variety of purposes, including communications, Earth observation, meteorology, navigation, space
            colonization, planetary exploration, and transportation of humans and cargo. All spacecraft except
            single-stage-to-orbit vehicles cannot get into space on their own, and require a launch vehicle (carrier
            rocket).

                    <strong>The history of spacecrafts </strong> A German V-2 became the first spacecraft when it
                    reached an altitude of 189 km in June 1944 in Peenemünde, Germany.[11] Sputnik 1 was the first
                    artificial satellite. It was launched into an elliptical low Earth orbit (LEO) by the Soviet Union
                    on 4 October 1957. The launch ushered in new political, military, technological, and scientific
                    developments; while the Sputnik launch was a single event, it marked the start of the Space
                    Age.[12][13] Apart from its value as a technological first, Sputnik 1 also helped to identify the
                    upper atmospheric layer's density, by measuring the satellite's orbital changes. It also provided
                    data on radio-signal distribution in the ionosphere. Pressurized nitrogen in the satellite's false
                    body provided the first opportunity for meteoroid detection. Sputnik 1 was launched during the
                    International Geophysical Year from Site No.1/5, at the 5th Tyuratam range, in Kazakh SSR (now at
                    the Baikonur Cosmodrome). The satellite travelled at 29,000 kilometres per hour (18,000 mph), taking
                    96.2 minutes to complete an orbit, and emitted radio signals at 20.005 and 40.002 MHz

                    While Sputnik 1 was the first spacecraft to orbit the Earth, other human-made objects had previously
                    reached an altitude of 100 km, which is the height required by the international organization
                    Fédération Aéronautique Internationale to count as a spaceflight. This altitude is called the Kármán
                    line. In particular, in the 1940s there were several test launches of the V-2 rocket, some of which
                    reached altitudes well over 100 km.

                        <strong>Crewed spacecraft </strong>As of 2016, only three nations have flown crewed spacecraft:
                        USSR/Russia, USA, and China. The first crewed spacecraft was Vostok 1, which carried Soviet
                        cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into space in 1961, and completed a full Earth orbit. There were five
                        other crewed missions which used a Vostok spacecraft.[14] The second crewed spacecraft was named
                        Freedom 7, and it performed a sub-orbital spaceflight in 1961 carrying American astronaut Alan
                        Shepard to an altitude of just over 187 kilometers (116 mi). There were five other crewed
                        missions using Mercury spacecraft.

                        Other Soviet crewed spacecraft include the Voskhod, Soyuz, flown uncrewed as Zond/L1, L3, TKS,
                        and the Salyut and Mir crewed space stations. Other American crewed spacecraft include the
                        Gemini spacecraft, the Apollo spacecraft including the Apollo Lunar Module, the Skylab space
                        station, the Space Shuttle with undetached European Spacelab and private US Spacehab space
                        stations-modules, and the SpaceX Crew Dragon configuration of their Dragon 2. US company Boeing
                        also developed and flown a spacecraft of their own, the CST-100, commonly referred to as
                        Starliner, but a crewed flight is yet to occur. China developed, but did not fly Shuguang, and
                        is currently using Shenzhou (its first crewed mission was in 2003).

                        Except for the Space Shuttle and the Buran spaceplane of the Soviet Union, the latter of which
                        only ever had one uncrewed test flight, all of the recoverable crewed orbital spacecraft were
                        space capsules.

                        <strong>Uncrewed spacecraft</strong> Uncrewed spacecraft are spacecraft without people on board.
                        Uncrewed spacecraft may have varying levels of autonomy from human input; they may be remote
                        controlled, remote guided or even autonomous, meaning they have a pre-programmed list of
                        operations, which they will execute unless otherwise instructed.

                        Many space missions are more suited to telerobotic rather than crewed operation, due to lower
                        cost and lower risk factors. In addition, some planetary destinations such as Venus or the
                        vicinity of Jupiter are too hostile for human survival. Outer planets such as Saturn, Uranus,
                        and Neptune are too distant to reach with current crewed spaceflight technology, so telerobotic
                        probes are the only way to explore them. Telerobotics also allows exploration of regions that
                        are vulnerable to contamination by Earth micro-organisms since spacecraft can be sterilized.
                        Humans can not be sterilized in the same way as a spaceship, as they coexist with numerous
                        micro-organisms, and these micro-organisms are also hard to contain within a spaceship or
                        spacesuit. Multiple space probes were sent to study Moon, the planets, the Sun, multiple small
                        Solar System bodies (comets and asteroids).

                        Special class of uncrewed spacecraft is space telescopes, a telescope in outer space used to
                        observe astronomical objects. The first operational telescopes were the American Orbiting
                        Astronomical Observatory, OAO-2 launched in 1968, and the Soviet Orion 1 ultraviolet telescope
                        aboard space station Salyut 1 in 1971. Space telescopes avoid the filtering and distortion
                        (scintillation) of electromagnetic radiation which they observe, and avoid light pollution which
                        ground-based observatories encounter. The best-known examples are Hubble Space Telescope and
                        James Webb Space Telescope.

                        Cargo spacecraft are designed to carry cargo, possibly to support space stations' operation by
                        transporting food, propellant and other supplies. Automated cargo spacecraft have been used
                        since 1978 and have serviced Salyut 6, Salyut 7, Mir, the International Space Station and
                        Tiangong space station.
